*  @brief Device side OpenCL implemenation of LDPC Decoder.  Includes logic to read data from UDP kernel and reorder packets
*           
*
*  @section DESCRIPTION
*
*  This program sets up the device side interface for a FPGA implemetation 
*  of a LDPC erasure decoder. This kernel is a single
*  work item, single workgroup kernel. It is intended to be used for a 
*  all supported code rates with either short or normal frame sizes
*
* To allow decoding in parallel with packet reception and reordering, I will need 3 buffers?
*  One to hold currently decoding block (previously received block)
*  One to hold main block that is being received at present time
*  One to hold future block that might trickle in while current block also being received?
*  Maybe not!  Why not allow decoding on currently assembling block?  It won't hurt anything to continue filling
* in erasures as decoding progresses... then use early stopping criteria to exit.
* So, current block that is being decoded is codeword_first if is_first_codeword==1, else codeword_second if is_first_codeword==0
* The other codeword buffer holds the next block that is being assembled.  When the current codeword is either fully decoded or
* a maximum number of iterations has been reached and the decoding fails, the buffers switch and the decoder begins working on the
* other buffer while the one that was being decoded previously is zeroed out and becomes the place to hold the next block's packets

* ASSUMPTIONS: 1) The symbol_type.is_erasure field is properly set to 1 for erased packets
*   and 0 for received packets.  
* 			   2) The symbol_type.symbol array is populated with all 0's for erased symbols since 
*	this field is XORed with the other symbols in a parity check regardless of erasure state
